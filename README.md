# ðŸ“¥ inbox-classifier

**inbox-classifier** is an email sorting tool that uses **machine learning** to classify Outlook Emails and move them into custom folders. It works via Outlookâ€™s COM interface, leveraging *Logistic Regression* to detect categories like spam, job applications and more if needed.

## How to Use

### Step 1: Scrape Emails to CSV

First we want to scrape the emails, you can change the max_size in the files.

Start the script, depending on your version:

```py src/scrape_emails.py``` OR ```python src/scrape_emails.py```

### Step 2: Manually label your Data

You can now copy your generated csv file from Step 1. and name the copy e.g, `emails_scraped_labeled.csv`

Now label your data manually with either `spam` or `ham`.

Note: (50-100) should be enough, but you can try it out yourself and explore what works best for you.
  
### Step 3: Train your Model

Note: This creates the model under the models folder, you can change parameters according to your needs.

```py src/train_model.py``` OR ```python src/train_model.py```

### Step 4: Classify and Sort Emails Automatically

Now you can classify and move your emails, after training.

```py src/classify_and_move_emails.py``` OR ```python src/classify_and_move_emails.py```
